# Antenna Tuner with Arduino and Android - New Interface

This repository contains the source code and schematics about Antenna Tuner with two capacitors (Servos) controlled by Android and Arduino with new user interface for Android.

Access [Bluetooth Remote Control for Magnetic Loop Antenna](https://github.com/pu2clr/Magnetic_Loop_Antenna_Tuner) for more detail. This documentation has more information about how can you start building an Antenna Tunner controlled by Arduino.


You can see about this project on my youtube channel:

Antenna Tuner with two capacitors controlled by Arduino (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwl3G2ET7Jw) and Part II Tuner Magnetic Loop Antenna for two capacitors and Arduino (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv-IV88IJV4).

Suggestions are welcome.
